<h1>Response to Floating Sheep Manifesto</h1>
    <p>“What would floating sheep map?” clearly outlines that people and geography shape each other and vice versa.  With that being said I position myself with the cartographers.  I understand that no map can ever be objective and it is a cartographer’s job to produce a map product that can be validated and/or discredited by looking at the raw data.  The problem with data is that it can be mined/skewed by individuals, institutions and governments to display their findings favorably or counter opponents findings.  That is why it is my priority is to create a map based on accurate empirical data, and carefully cite all the data sources used. I believe that this kind transparency allows readers to make educated conclusions about why a map looks the way it does.  An active observer will scrutinize a map a determine whether or not the data has been collected and processed to serve special interest group’s agenda or whether a map is just relaying information objectively.  </p>
    <p>I believe that points 2a and 2b are the most problematic in an age of information inundation.  Most individuals take information at face value and take little time scrutinize what they read or see.  The problem is that if “all maps lie”, “but lies are the source of a maps’ power” then they can be used to manipulate a passive audience.  The power of maps becomes dangerous in times of state and national elections.  Maps could be used to serve a candidate’s fear mongering campaign that crime is on the rise or show spurious correlations between decreased employment and an influx in immigrants or refugees into the state or country. Using maps in this fashion can turn the tide of an election, electing the least qualified candidate.  Harking back to “What would a floating sheep map?”, candidates can prioritize their maps to portray their reality of the world and establishing their reality as the new Jerusalem.  As a result segment of the population are blinded by the new Jerusalem put forth by the candidate.  They fail to see the true reality of the modern world and how interconnected the world has become and interdependency between nation states.</p>
